# Xanity 2.0 PHP RAT

This is a xanity leak for those interested in malware research. 

It  keeps the stub updated and FUD and with its built-in Scanner, that does not distribute, 
it will be FUD almost for a while. Xanity uses CodeDom to compile the Stub to a very low Size(49kb). 
This program was written in VB (.Net Framework required) and uses PHP to communicate with the servers, so this works without opening any port.
